> ${SITE_NAME} is an Oklahoma-focused telehealth platform that connects patients with state-licensed physicians for online medical marijuana (MMJ) evaluations and physician certifications through HIPAA-compliant telehealth consultations. The company does not cultivate, sell, or dispense cannabis products. The platform facilitates physician-issued recommendations recognized under Oklahoma's OMMA (Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority) program, allowing qualifying patients to apply for a state medical marijuana patient license and access licensed dispensaries where permitted by law.

- Oklahoma-only medical marijuana evaluation service; headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
- Consultations are conducted entirely online; most physician recommendations can be completed in about 15–30 minutes if the patient is approved.
- Patients receive guidance for the OMMA application process after a successful physician recommendation.
- 100% refund guaranteed if the physician does not approve the patient (see Refund Policy).
- HIPAA-compliant intake and consultation; physician licensure verified for Oklahoma practice.
- Not a dispensary, not a recreational cannabis service, and not an in-person clinic chain.
