    question: "Is this a walk-in clinic?",
    answer:
      "Not exactly. We do evaluations by telehealth, so the Oklahoma City address is really our office for staff and paperwork. You're welcome to stop by if you'd rather talk to someone in person first, but the actual visit with a physician happens over video.",
  },
  {
    question: "How soon can I get an appointment?",
    answer:
      "Depends on the day, but most people who reach out during business hours get scheduled the same day or the next one.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I contact you about renewing my card instead of a new application?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Just let us know when you reach out that you're renewing, and we'll pull up your previous visit and get you booked before your card expires.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are your hours?",
    answer:
      "9:00 AM to 10:00 PM daily by phone or in person. Anything sent outside those hours gets answered the next business day.",
