            Why We Built This for Oklahoma
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-white/85">
            Oklahoma has one of the most active medical marijuana programs in the country, but
            the process can still feel confusing on a first try. Between OMMA&apos;s requirements
            and knowing which conditions qualify, a lot of patients get stuck before they even
            book an appointment. We built Medical Marijuana Doctor Oklahoma to give patients here
            a clear, honest path to a physician certification, without hidden fees or confusing
            paperwork.
